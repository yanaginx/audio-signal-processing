## Audio signal processing

My implementation on the assignments and programming demonstration for the course [Audio Signal Processing for Music Application](https://www.coursera.org/learn/audio-signal-processing) on Coursera

---

The **sms-tools** needed for the course can be found [here](https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools).

> For easier access to the models and the functions in the **sms-tools**, I suggest adding the `sms-tools/software/models` and the `sms-tools` directory as `PYTHONPATH`

- For Windows users:
  - Create a _System variable_ called `PYTHONPATH`
  - Add the mentioned directories as its value then you are good to go
